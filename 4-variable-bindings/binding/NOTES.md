# Notes

### Takeaways
- Using `let` (binding) we can bind a value (literal) to a variable.
- Variable binding *may* include type annotation, the compiler is able to *infer* the type from the context.
- The compiler warns about unused variable binding, which can be silenced by prefixing the variable name with an `_` (underscore).
