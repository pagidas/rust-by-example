# Notes

### Takeaways
#### Scoping
- Inside any scope, you can define an anonymous one by just opening and closing brackets `{}`
- Bindings can be defined even in anonymous scopes but are not accessible from an outer one

#### Shadowing
- Variable shadowing is allowed
- Bidings can shadow previous ones, but the above rules on scoping remain true
